This repo contains only a sample of some code I've written in the main project.

Check out this repository if you wish to see the actual repository: https://github.com/VatsalBhuva11/EcoBloom
<h1>About this sample</h1>
The two folders in the project directory (functions and src) are for backend and frontend respectively. I was responsible for coding out all the code that is there in this sample.
<br/>
<br/>

If I were to highlight a specific part out of all the code in this sample, it would be the code responsible for handling the **multi-step authentication forms**, and handling **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** using Firebase's Custom Claims feature.

<br/>
<br/>
The primary files/folders handling these are:
<ol>
  <li>functions/index.js</li>
  <li>functions/controllers/userAuth.controllers.js</li>
  <li>functions/controllers/orgAuth.controllers.js</li>
  <li>src/</li>
</ol>

<h1>Thank you</h1>
